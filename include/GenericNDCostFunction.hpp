/**
 * This class acts as a cost function for any ND model, i.e., a model that
 * derives from the GenericNDModel class. For example, you can pass your model
 * and data to the constructor and a cost function will be created. You can
 * then, for example, pass the result straight to any of the Unfit optimisers to
 * find your model parameters. Of course you could also write your own cost
 * function, or embed your model in a cost function, but why not let this class
 * do the work for you. In terms of maths, if we write something like
 * y = f(x0, x1, x2, ... ,xN), your model will implement f(x0, x1, x2, ... ,xN).
 * Here we assume you have some data, y, x0, x1, ..., and you want to see if
 * your model is a good fit to your y data. To do this we introduce a residual.
 * For every data point, i, we will calculate the residual r_i = y_i - f(x_i).
 * The cost of the model is the vector of these residuals.
