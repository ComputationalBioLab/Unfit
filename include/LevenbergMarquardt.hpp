 * \brief A class to implement the Levenberg Marquardt optimization method
 *
 * This class implements the Levenberg Marquardt optimization method. It
 * requires a cost function (written by the user) and an initial guess of the
 * unknown parameters. It then proceeds to try to find a set of parameters that
 * minimize the cost function.
 *
 * The inspiration for this implementation was derived from the book:
 *   Methods for Non-linear Least Squares Problems,
 *   by K. Madsen, H.B. Nielsen, O. Tingleff.
 * At the time of writing, this was freely available online. There is also a
 * sample matlab implementation on their website that was useful for getting the
 * Broyden rank one updates to work.

   * \brief Implements the Levenberd-Marquardt optimization method.
   *
   * This method takes in a cost function (user supplied) and an initial guess
   * for the unknown parameters and uses the Levenberd-Marquardt algorithm to
   * try to find the set of parameters that provides a minimum cost. This is
   * implemented as a nonlinear least squares problem, so the cost will always
   * be >= 0. This is known as a local optimizer, so the results you get will
   * depend on how good the initial guess is.
   *
   * Intended use:
   *   auto rc = object.FindMin(cost_function, coordinates)
   *
   * \param cost_function residuals to be tested
   * \param coordinates vector of initial guesses
   * \return 0 if successful \n
   *         1 if empty coordinates are passed in \n
   *         2 if the initial coordinates are out of bounds \n
   *         3 if the the data_points < number of variables \n
   *         4 if the maximum number of function evaluations was exceeded \n
   *         5 if the maximum number of iterations has been exceeded \n
   *         6 if the initial cost is not finite \n
   *         7 if the solution breaks down (nu gets very large)
