/**
 * \mainpage Welcome to Unfit 3.2: Data fitting and optimization software
 *
 * Does Matlab's fminsearch solve your problems but run too slow? Does Scilab
 * handle your problems but runs even slower? Unfit may be the solution you are
 * looking for. Unfit provides access to six popular optimization algorithms
 * through a common and highly customizable interface. The algorithms are:
 *
 *   - Differential Evolution (global minimizer, non-derivative)
 *   - Genetic Algorithm (global minimizer, non-derivative)
 *   - Levenberg Marquardt (local minimizer, derivative based)
 *   - Nelder Mead Simplex (local minimizer, non-derivative)
 *   - Particle Swarm (global minimizer, non-derivative)
 *   - Simulated Annealing (global minimizer, non-derivative)
 *
 * Want to try, for example, a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm approach? No problem.
 * Just pass the solution from your Genetic Algorithm to one of the local
 * minimizers and you are done. All it takes is two extra lines of code.
 *
 * To solve your own optimization problems, all you need to do is to write your
 * own cost function. It can be very simple (see our Parabolic example) or it
 * can be as complex as you like.
 *
 * We have designed Unfit with the following key features:
 *
 *   - Speed
 *   - Bounds (box) constraints
 *   - Handles discontinuous functions
 *   - Pure C++ implementation (not a wrapper for C)
 *   - Modern C++ style (uses C++11)
 *   - Highly extensible cost functions
 *   - Flexibility to set your own options or use our defaults
 *   - Well tested (100% line and function coverage)
 *
 * Check out our web page for a tutorial on how to write your own cost function,
 * and (if interested) our guide on how to write your own optimizer using the
 * Unfit framework.
