/**
 * \brief A class to implement the Particle Swarm optimization method
 *
 * This class implements the Particle Swarm optimization method. It
 * requires a cost function (written by the user) and an initial guess of the
 * unknown parameters. The initial guess is only needed to obtain the number
 * of unknowns, so make sure it is of the correct length. The algorithm will
 * proceed to try to find a set of parameters that minimize the cost function.
 *
 * The idea behind Particle Swarm comes from Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi.
 * Inspiration for this implementation was derived from the paper entitled
 * "Chaos-enhanced accelerated particle swarm optimization" written by
 * Amir Hossein Gandomi, Gun Jin Yun, Xin-She Yang and Siamak Talatahari.
 *
 * This class also includes the chaotic maps from the same paper in an effort
 * to further enhance convergence. By default the chaotic maps are not enabled.
 * To use them you need to set ps.options.UseAdaptiveParameters(true). Then you
 * can select which map via ps.options.SetStrategy(x). In total, there are 12
 * chaotic maps included, selected via indices ranging from 1 to 12.

   * \brief A method to find the minimum of a model/function using a Particle
   * Swarm approach.
   *
   * This is the main method to call to perform a minimization of the provided
   * cost function. Here a Particle Swarm optimization technique is adopted.
   * There are a few points worth noting before starting the optimization.
   * First, make sure that the length of the coordinates vector that is passed
   * in to this method matches the number of unknowns you expect in your cost
   * function. As the cost function is user supplied there is no way of checking
   * these match. The values you supply are not important as the initial
   * population is randomly generated (unless you invoke the
   * SetAddInitialToPopulation option). The final result (coordinates
   * with best fit) is returned in the coordinates vector. Second, it is
   * advisable to add bounds to each of the variables in the fit. The algorithm
   * generates possible answers between the provided bounds, and if no bounds
   * are provided the bounds are +/- the maximum double the computer can
   * represent. Chances are you know enough about the problem to make more
   * sensible choices. Convergence with +/- 1e8, for example, is still much
   * faster than the default bounds. By default the solution can move outside
   * the bounds that are set. To prevent this, invoke the SetUseHardBounds
   * option. Finally, if you want to use an external population generator, you
   * can use that as the initial population instead of generating one here. You
   * can invoke the SetPopulation method (from the GenericOptimizer class) to
   * achieve this.
   *
   * Intended use:
   *   ParticleSwarm ps; \n
   *   auto rc = ps.FindMin(CostFunction, coordinates);
   *
   * \param CostFunction The user-supplied function to minimise
   * \param coordinates On input must be the same size as the number of
   *        parameters required by the cost function. On exit returns the
   *        coordinates that provided the minimum cost.
   * \return Zero upon success, non-zero upon failure. \n
   *        -2 = User supplied a population that was invalid \n
   *        -1 = Empty coordinate vector \n
   *         1 = Maximum number of function evaluations was reached \n
