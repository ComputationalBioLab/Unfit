 * \brief A class to implement the Simulated Annealing optimization method
 *
 * This class implements the Simulated Annealing optimization method. It
 * requires a cost function (written by the user) and an initial guess of the
 * unknown parameters. The initial guess is only needed to obtain the number
 * of unknowns, so make sure it is of the correct length. The algorithm will
 * proceed to try finding a set of parameters that minimizes the cost function.
 *
 * The inspiration for this implementation was derived from the book:
 * Belegundu, A. D., & Chandrupatla, T. R. (2011). Optimization concepts and
 * applications in engineering. Cambridge University Press.
 * In particular, look at Chapter 7 for their recommendations of the Simulated
 * Annealing algorithm implementation.

   * \brief A method to find a minimum point of a function using a Simulated
   * Annealing approach.
   *
   * This is the main method to call so as to perform a minimization of the
   * provided cost function. Here, a Simulated Annealing optimization technique
   * is adopted. There are a few points worth noting before starting the
   * optimization. First, make sure that the length of the coordinates vector
   * passed in to this function matches the number of unknowns you have in your
   * cost function. As the cost function is supplied by user, there is no way of
   * checking if the two match up. By default, the vector you supply is not used
   * (other than to see it's length, and a random initial guess is generated
   * within the specified bounds. However, if you want to start from your guess
   * simply call:
   *
   *   sa.options.SetAddInitialToPopulation(true);
   *
   * before you call FindMin, and we will use yours. Next, it is highly
   * advisable to add bounds to each of the variables in the fit. The algorithm
   * generates possible answers between the provided bounds, and if no bounds
   * are provided the bounds are +/- the maximum double the computer can
   * represent (read - slow). Chances are you know enough about the problem to
   * make a more sensible choice. Lastly, the final result (answer with the
   * best fit) is returned in the coordinates vector.
   *
   * Intended use:
   *   int rc = object.FindMin(cost_function, coordinates)
   *
   * \param CostFunction The user-supplied function to minimize
   * \param coordinates On input, it must be the same size as the number of
   *        unknown parameters in the cost function. On exit, it returns the
   *        values of the unknown parameters that provided the minimum cost.
   * \return Zero upon success, non-zero upon failure. \n
   *        -1 = Empty coordinate vector \n
   *        -2 = Initial user supplied coordinates are out of bounds \n
   *        -3 = Cost of the initial coordinates is inf or nan \n
   *         1 = Maximum number of function evaluations was reached \n
   *         2 = Maximum number of iterations was reached
