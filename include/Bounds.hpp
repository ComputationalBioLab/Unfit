 * safety, internally a pair of bounds should be created for all variables, even
 * if there is no desire to set them to specific values. This is as easy as
 * passing the number of variables to the constructor (if known), or later
 * calling SetNumberOfBounds which will also create the default bounds for you.
 * Remember that all indices start from zero in C++, so that is the location of
 * the first bound. Note that bounds are always set (or removed) in pairs, so
 * if there is an upper bound there will always be a lower bound.
