/**
 * This is model that contains a single first order, ordinary differential
 * equation (ODE). The equation has two parameters, c0, and c1, and looks like:
 *
 *   dy/dt = c0*y + c1
 *
 * If we choose to solve this equation numerically with a forward Euler
 * approach, we can discretize the derivative term in the ODE above and
 * rearrange to get an update equation:
 *
 *   y(t+dt) = y(t) + dt*[c0*y(t) + c1]
 *
 * It is this discretized equation that is implemented in the model. Of course
 * you could implement another more sophisticated integration scheme (e.g.
 * Improved Euler or Runge-Kutta) if you wanted to. The result is an initial
 * value problem, so we require an initial value for y (i.e., y(t=0)) to get
 * started.
