 * A model of a parabola, which has three parameters. The function is given by:
 *
 *   f(x) = c0*x*x + c1*x + c2
 *
 * In terms of terminology, we have a three parameter two-dimensional model. The
 * three parameters come from us having three c's (c0, c1, c2). The
 * two-dimensional part comes from us having a function of two variables, i.e.,
 * we could write this function in the form y = f(x), where x & y are our two
 * variables.
