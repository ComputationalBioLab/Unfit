 * \brief Fit a three parameter first order ordinary differential equation (ODE)
 *
 * This is an example data fitting problem with two parameters for a single
 * first order ordinary differential equation (ODE). Here the goal is to fit
 * the following ODE to some experimental data:
 *
 *   dx/dt = Ax + B
 *
 * This is an initial value problem, and the third parameter here is the value
 * of that initial condition. The goal is to find the values of A & B, and the
 * initial condition x(0), that best fit the data. In terms of the model,
 * A = param[0], B = param[1], and x(0) = param[2].
